# SketchProject
This is my first project using javascript.
The board is initially a 16X16 grid and when your mouse hovers over it the tiles change to white.
If you press the "Change board size" button the browser will ask for a new board size and will create a new "sketching" grid accordingly.
If you press "reset board" the same board will reset the canvas.
